Who do you want to be? An employee, self-employed, a business owner or an investor?
Each is a significantly different way of viewing oneself. It is possible to be in more than one role too. These roles describes in Cashflow Quadrant -:
E FOR EMPLOYEE
 
As an Employee, you have a Job. (A person who earns money by holding a job and working for someone else or a company.)
The majority of a population has an employee mindset. They wake up, work hard, get a paycheck, and go to sleep. There’s nothing wrong with that; it’s a very honorable lifestyle. Unfortunately, it often leaves them financially insecure or, if they’re smart about saving up and investing appropriately, financially secure. While this role used to carry little risk, nowadays, layoffs have removed the guarantees this role used to afford. In this category, you trade your time for money, typically working 30 to 80 hours a week for a salary. For example, you could be a teacher, secretary, engineer, banker, pilot, nurse, doctor, lawyer or CEO of a company.
The core value of employees is Security.
As an Employee, you will pay the most in taxes and you must continue to trade time for money. When you stop work, your salary also stops.

S FOR SELF-EMPLOYED
A person who earns money working for him/herself.
As a Self-Employed, you own a Job. Real estate agents, insurance agents, doctors, lawyers, consultants and accountants with their own practice, photographers and graphic designers with their own studios and small business owners belong to this category.
In this category, you are still trading your time for money. In most cases, you may work even longer hours than the Employees and you have no paid vacations. When you stop working, your income drops or stops.
You can always tell who are the Self-Employed by their core values and the words they use. “If you want it done right, do it by yourself.”
Self-Employed also pay heavily in taxes and they must trade their time for money.
Most big businesses start off as Self-Employed; as they put in a System and a Team, they have a chance to grow to become big businesses.
 
B FOR BIG BUSINESS OWNER
 
A person who owns a business that generates money.
For Big Business owners, they are looking for good Systems, good Network, and the smartest people they know to help run their business.
Unlike the “S”, they don’t want to run the company by themselves. They want to have a team of smart people run the company for them.
As a Big Business owner, they have people work hard for them. They pay the least in taxes and their business continue to generate a cash flow for them even when they sleep or vacation.
You can always tell who are the Big Business Owners by their core values and the words they use.
“Let’s have a System and put the best Team in place.” – System and Team are the 2 key elements to transition from Self-Employed (S) to Big Business Owner (B).
In this Category, you can work hard for a few years and, once your System and Team are in place, you could potentially earn passive income that keeps flowing to you for the rest of your life.
I FOR INVESTORS
 
A person who earns money from their various investments – in other words, money that generates more money.
Even fewer others become full-time investors, such as angel investors and venture capitalists. The investor role, however, isn’t just about doing it full-time. Anyone can be an investor. It is not just about buying stocks. If you have money in a mutual fund or 401k plan, you are already an investor. This role is characterized by being able to assess a company’s or industry’s projected perceived performance. The financial rewards vary greatly; very few can make a living just being an investor. Those who do oftentimes got here because they were self-employed, owned a business, or were an employee of a young company that offered significant equity and later became wildly successful (which is extremely rare).
